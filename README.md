<summary>Contributing code</summary>

You are responsible for the full lifecycle to get your code integerated into `master`:

1. Create a new branch from `master`.<sup>1</sup>
2. Push your branch and create an MR with prefix `WIP:`.<sup>2,3</sup>
3. Rebase on `master` with `git pull --rebase origin master` before requesting a review.
4. Request a review on Slack. [Mention someone](https://slack.com/intl/en-be/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack#mention-someone) if no one takes action.
5. Address the comments and ask the reviewer to validate that they are resolved. Repeat until there are no unresolved comments.
6. Rebase on `master` with `git pull --rebase origin master`.
7. Bump the version with `invoke bump [patch|minor|major]`.<sup>4</sup>
8. Merge the MR and ensure that your branch is deleted.

Notes:

1. Prefix your branch name with a [Jira issue key](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-an-issue/#Workingwithissues-Projectandissuekeys), or your initials if there is no related Jira issue.
2. The `WIP:` prefix indicates that the MR is still a Work In Progress.
3. A good commit message completes the sentence "[If applied, this commit will ...](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)".
4. Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to decide whether you bump the patch, minor, or major version.
